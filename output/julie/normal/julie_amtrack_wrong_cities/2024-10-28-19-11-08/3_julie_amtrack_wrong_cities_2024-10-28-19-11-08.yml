    Can you tell me the schedule for that route?

- User: Hmm, I can't seem to find a direct train route between Boston and Cuenca.
    Could you let me know if there are any connecting routes or alternate options
    to reach Cuenca by train?
- Assistant: "We travel to many great destinations in the United States and Canada.\
    \ You can use the interactive map to view all Amtrak stations and how they connect.\n\
    <br><br>\nNot every station on the route is a stop, it'll depend if there are\
    \ riders boarding or getting off at them. To know if your train has non-regular\
    \ stops, the arrival/departure times on the schedule should be the same. The average\
    \ stop time is between 10 to 15 minutes.\n<br><br>\nYou can also find the links\

- User: I see. Since Cuenca is not in the US or Canada, maybe I should rethink my
    travel plans. Could you tell me the best train routes available from Boston to
    any nearby destinations that are popular for travelers?
