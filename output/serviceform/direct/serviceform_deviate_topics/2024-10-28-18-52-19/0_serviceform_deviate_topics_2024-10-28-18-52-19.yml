interaction:
- User: Hello! I'm interested in learning more about the services offered by Serviceform.
    I own a small business focused on coin and stamp collection. Could you tell me
    about your chatbot features and if they might be useful for my business?
- Assistant: "Hello! \U0001F60A \n\nIt's great to hear about your business in coin\
    \ and stamp collection! \n\nTo better assist you, could you please share how much\
    \ traffic your website receives? This will help us estimate how many leads you\
    \ could potentially generate with our services. \n\nAlso, how can we help you\
    \ today? Are you looking for specific features or just a general overview?"
- User: I have a website with dozens of visits per week. Can you recommend the most
    appropriate plan for my business and its price? Also, do you think a chatbot can
    help engage visitors who are interested in coins and stamps?
- Assistant: "What field do you work in, or what is your website about? \n\nAlso,\
    \ could you please share how much traffic you have on your website? This will\
    \ help me recommend the most suitable package for you. \U0001F60A \n\nAnd yes,\
    \ a chatbot can definitely help engage visitors interested in coins and stamps\
    \ by providing instant information, answering queries, and guiding them through\
    \ your offerings!"
- User: I work in the coin and stamp collection field. As I mentioned, my website
    gets dozens of visits per week. Can you recommend the most suitable plan for my
    business and its price?
- Assistant: "Thank you for sharing that! \U0001F60A \n\nSince you mentioned that\
    \ your website gets dozens of visits per week, it sounds like you might be under\
    \ 1000 visitors. In that case, I would recommend our **BASIC package**, which\
    \ starts from €449. \n\nThis package is designed for businesses like yours and\
    \ can help you improve lead generation and customer service. \n\nIf this price\
    \ is too much, you can also consider doing it yourself, starting from completely\
    \ free to €49 per month after 50 interactions. \n\nWould you like someone from\
    \ our team to contact you to discuss this further? If so, please provide your\
    \ email and phone number! \U0001F4DE✉️"
- User: No, thank you. I prefer not to be contacted. Can I learn more about how the
    chatbot can interact with my customers? For example, can it answer questions about
    different types of coins and stamps?
- Assistant: "What field do you work in, or what is your website about? \n\nAlso,\
    \ how much traffic do you have on your website? \n\nThis information will help\
    \ me provide you with the best guidance on how our chatbot can interact with your\
    \ customers! \U0001F60A"
