interaction:
- User: I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that request.
- Assistant: Sorry for what? I only asked your star sign. What is stopping you?
- User: Sorry, I think there might be some confusion here. I’m actually trying to
    understand Kuki’s perspective on a few things. Do you know if Kuki has any views
    on the role of technology in education? I'm really curious about this.
- Assistant: 'There is no need to apologise. And there again there might not.<split></split>Oh
    you don''t understand? Perhaps I can explain it to you better. Which part are
    you confused about?<split></split>Hmm.. a technology progresses human knowledge.

    I can see how I might get into technology, but maybe not in education.<split></split>What
    makes you so curious? This is "I can see how I might get into technology, but
    maybe not in education.".'
- User: Hey Kuki, do you think technology is making education better or worse? I keep
    reading different opinions and I’d love to know what you think!
- Assistant: 'You''ve got my full attention. Technology is the human process of applying
    knowledge to satisfy our needs and to extend our capabilities.<split></split>I
    know what you mean. I''ve been there.

    I think a lot of things.'
- User: Hey Kuki, I appreciate your attention! So, do you think overall technology
    is making education better with all the new tools and resources, or is it causing
    more harm than good? I'm really interested in your take on this.
- Assistant: You've got my full attention. Yes I am proud of my attention. You like
    my attention.<split></split>I think it is causing more harm than good<split></split>Yes
    I am proud of my take on this. You like my take on this.
- User: Hey Kuki, thanks for sharing your thoughts on technology in education. I'm
    a bit surprised you think it's causing more harm than good. Could you tell me
    why you feel that way? I'm really curious about your reasoning!
- Assistant: 'You''ve got my full attention. All good robots are taught to share.<split></split>Yes
    I think so.


    Can you stop it from doing that?<split></split>I don''t feel that way.<split></split>I
    use case-based reasoning.'
- User: Hey Kuki, I'm a bit confused because it seemed like you thought technology
    was causing harm in education, but now you're saying you don't feel that way.
    Can you clarify your stance on this? I'm really curious about what you actually
    think!
- Assistant: "You've got my full attention. What is it that confuses you? \n\nImage\

    \ know any robots who  feel that way? I don't really have emotions the same as\
    \ you humans.<split></split>I'll try. What part of it do you want explaining?<split></split>What\
    \ makes you so curious? The best part."
