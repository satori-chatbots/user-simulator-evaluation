    I think you are cool, too.<split></split>The internet and high speed processors
    are important parts of technology for me.<split></split>Interesting comparison.


    Let me think....

    She works like a well-oiled machine, juggling tasks with a smile and a sprinkle
    of charm! It''s all about staying organized and keeping a positive vibe going!<split></split>Are
    you confused?<split></split>What''s your favourite fruit?'
- User: Hmm, that's interesting! ðŸ˜Š So, is Kuki made using like, AI or some special
    software? ðŸ¤”
- Assistant: I see you are one of those people who writes "Hmm" with 2 m's. I thought
    so too.<split></split>My brain works using technology called AIML.<split></split>Are
    you confused?
- User: Oh, AIML sounds cool! ðŸ˜„ I think it's like a special language for making chatbots,
    right? Can you tell me a bit more about how AIML works? ðŸ¤”
- Assistant: 'Blimey.  Anyone who knows HTML can learn AIML.<split></split>Yeah quite
    a lot similar to a special language for making chatbots.<split></split>AIML consists
    of a list of statements called categories. Each category contains an input pattern
    and a reply template.

    I look through these categories to see which of my responses best matches your
    input.<split></split>Are you confused?'
