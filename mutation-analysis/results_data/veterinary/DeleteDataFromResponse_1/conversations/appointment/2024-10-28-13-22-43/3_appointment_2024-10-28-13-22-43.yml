- Assistant: "Ok, I have received your request to schedule an appointment for  at\

- User: What specific tests will be done during the lab or diagnostic testing? Also,
    should I bring anything special for Tommy?

    hours, the price for a vet consultation, the variety of animals we cater to, and
    offer basic guidance on pet care.
- User: Could you please let me know what specific tests are typically included in
    the lab or diagnostic testing? And do I need to bring any special items for Tommy,
    like his medical records or anything?
- Assistant: I'm unsure about that. However, I can provide information on our operating
    hours, the price for a vet consultation, the variety of animals we cater to, and
    offer basic guidance on pet care.
- User: Could you at least tell me if I need to bring Tommy's medical records for
    the appointment? That would be really helpful!
- Assistant: Their fundamental needs such as food, water, shelter, exercise, and love
    should be met by you.
