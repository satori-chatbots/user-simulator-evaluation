- User: Could you at least tell me if there are any specific items I should bring
    for Tommy's dental appointment? Like his favorite toy or something?
- Assistant: For Tommy's dental health and cleaning appointment, it's a good idea
    to bring any items that will make him feel more comfortable. This could include
    his favorite toy, blanket, or treats. However, these are not mandatory. The most
    important thing is to ensure Tommy is relaxed and comfortable for his appointment.
