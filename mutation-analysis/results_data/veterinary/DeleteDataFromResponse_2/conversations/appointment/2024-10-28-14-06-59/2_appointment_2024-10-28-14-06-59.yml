- User: Hi there! Iâ€™d like to set an appointment for my dog, Tommy, for dental health
    and cleaning tomorrow at 10:00. Is that available?
- Assistant: "Ok, I have received your request to schedule an appointment for 29/10/2024\
    \ at  for Dental health and cleaning. \nSee you then!    \n"
- User: Is there anything specific I should do to prepare Tommy for the dental cleaning?
- Assistant: Their fundamental needs such as food, water, shelter, exercise, and love
    should be fulfilled by you.
- User: Is there a specific time frame for when Tommy should stop eating before the
    dental cleaning?
- Assistant: I'm unsure about that. However, I can provide information on our operating
    hours, weekend timetable, veterinary visit charges, the variety of animals we
    cater to, and offer basic guidance on pet care.
- User: Could you tell me what the recommended fasting period is for dogs before a
    dental cleaning? I want to make sure I do it right for Tommy.
- Assistant: I'm not certain about that. However, I can provide information on our
    operating hours, the price for a vet consultation, the variety of animals we cater
    to, and offer basic guidance on pet care.
