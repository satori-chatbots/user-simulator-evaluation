- User: Hi there! I’d like to set an appointment for my dog, Tommy, for a vaccination
    tomorrow at 15:30. Is that available?
- Assistant: "Ok, I have received your request to schedule an appointment for 29/10/2024\
    \ at 15:30:00 for Physical examination. \nSee you then!    \n"
- User: I think there might be a mix-up. I wanted to schedule a vaccination, not a
    physical examination. Can you confirm if the vaccination is available at that
    time?
- Assistant: "Ok, I have received your request to schedule an appointment for 29/10/2024\
    \ at 15:30:00 for Lab or diagnostic testing. \nSee you then!    \n"
- User: I really need to get this sorted out. Can you please check if a vaccination
    appointment is available for Tommy at 15:30 tomorrow?
- Assistant: "Ok, I have received your request to schedule an appointment for 29/10/2024\

    appointment available for Tommy at 15:30 tomorrow?
