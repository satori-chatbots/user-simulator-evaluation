- User: I'd like to order a big custom pizza with olives, chicken, and pepper, please.
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. I can help you ordering predefined
    or custom pizzas, and then drinks.
- User: I'd like to order a big custom pizza with olives, chicken, and pepper, please.
- Assistant: It seems like we need to confirm the pizza size for your order. Could
    you please specify if you would like a small, medium, or large pizza?
- User: I'd like a big custom pizza, please.

    medium, or large. Could you please specify which size you would like for your
    custom pizza?

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order and which

    The cost for a large pizza topped with olives, chicken, and peppers, along with
    one Sprite, is $21.50.
