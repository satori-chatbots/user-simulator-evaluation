- User: I'd like to order a large marinara pizza, please.
- Assistant: It seems like you want a large pizza, but I noticed a small typo in the
    pizza type. Could you please confirm if you meant "marinera" or if you would like
    a different type? The available options are margarita, carbonara, marinera, hawaiian,
    four cheese, and vegetarian.
- User: Yes, I meant a large marinera pizza.
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a large marinera pizza!

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order and which
    type of drink you prefer? The options are coke, sprite, or water.'
- User: I'd like to order 2 cans of water, please.
- Assistant: 'Error: 500 Internal Server Error: Error executing the engine: Data is
    missing the property pizza_size'
