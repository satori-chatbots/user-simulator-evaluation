- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?

    please.
- Assistant: 'I see that you''d like a large pizza with cheese and pepperoni, but
    it seems like "peppers" is not an accepted topping. Could you please confirm if
    you''d like to replace "peppers" with another topping from the following options:
    mushrooms, ham, bacon, olives, corn, or chicken?'
- User: I'd like to keep the large custom pizza with cheese and pepperoni, please.
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a large pizza with cheese and pepperoni!

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order and which
    type of drinks you prefer? The options are coke, sprite, or water.'
