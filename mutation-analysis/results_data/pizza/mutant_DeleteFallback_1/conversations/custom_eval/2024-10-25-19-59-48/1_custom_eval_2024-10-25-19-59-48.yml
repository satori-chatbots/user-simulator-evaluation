    please.
- Assistant: 'It looks like we have the toppings as pepperoni and chicken, but "peppers"
    is not an accepted topping. Could you please confirm if you would like to replace
    "peppers" with another topping from the following options: cheese, mushrooms,
    pepper, ham, bacon, olives, or corn? Also, could you please confirm the pizza
    size as small, medium, or large?'

- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a medium pizza with pepperoni and chicken!

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order and which
    type of drinks you prefer? The options available are coke, sprite, or water.'
