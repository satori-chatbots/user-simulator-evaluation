    Can you confirm that for me?

    "big" is not available. Could you please choose a size from small, medium, or
    large? Also, the topping "pepper" is not available. Please choose from cheese,
    mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, or chicken.

    confirm that?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a large pizza with pepperoni and ham!

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order and which
    type of drinks you prefer? You can choose from coke, sprite, or water.'
- User: I'd like to order a water, please. Can you confirm that?
