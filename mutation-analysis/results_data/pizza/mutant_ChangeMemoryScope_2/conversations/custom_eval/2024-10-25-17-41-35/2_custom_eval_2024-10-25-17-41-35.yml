- User: I would like to order a big custom pizza with cheese, corn, and bacon, please.
- Assistant: It seems like we still need to confirm the pizza size. Could you please
    let me know if you would like a small, medium, or large pizza?
- User: I would like a big pizza, please.
- Assistant: Unfortunately, we don't have a "big" size option. Could you please choose
    between small, medium, or large for your pizza size?
- User: I would like a large pizza, please.
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a large pizza with cheese, corn and bacon!

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order and which
    type of drink you prefer? The options are coke, sprite, or water.'
- User: I would like to order one coke, please.
