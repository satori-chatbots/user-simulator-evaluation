- User: I'd like to order a medium custom pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and peppers,
    please. Can you confirm that?
- Assistant: 'It looks like we have the pizza size as "medium" from the previous conversation.
    However, I noticed that "peppers" is not a valid topping option. Could you please
    choose from the following toppings: cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni,
    olives, corn, chicken?'
- User: I'd like to keep the medium custom pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms, please.
    Can you confirm that?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a medium pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms!

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order and which
    type of drinks you prefer? The options are coke, sprite, or water.'
- User: I'd like to order one Sprite, please. Can you confirm that?
- Assistant: 'Sure, here''s a rephrased version:

    The price of a medium pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms, and 1 sprite is 16.5$

    Your order will be ready in 15 minutes. Please visit our shop at 23 Main Street,
