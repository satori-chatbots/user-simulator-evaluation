- User: Hi, Iâ€™m Maria Smith. I need an estimate for creating 3D renderings of 5 sculptures
    for my art gallery. What would that cost?
- Assistant: Thank you for providing some of the information, Maria. I have noted
    that you need 3D renderings for 5 artworks. Could you please confirm the type
    of artworks? I have "sculptures" noted, but I want to make sure that's correct.
- User: Yes, that's correct. I'm looking for 3D renderings of 5 sculptures. What would
    the estimate be for that?

    The cost is estimated to be approximately $14,500, though it may vary based on
    factors such as the size of the artworks.'
