- User: Hi, I’m Maria Smith. I’d like to get an estimate for creating 3D renderings
    of 4 ceramic objects for my gallery. What would that cost?
- Assistant: Thank you for providing some of the information, Maria. I have noted
    that you are interested in 3D renderings of ceramic objects. Could you please
    confirm the number of artworks you would like to have rendered? I have noted 4,
    but I want to make sure that's correct.
- User: Yes, that's correct. I want 3D renderings of 4 ceramic objects. What would
    the total cost be for that?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for giving those details!.

    The cost is estimated to be approximately $5,800, but it may vary based on factors
    such as the size of the artworks.'
