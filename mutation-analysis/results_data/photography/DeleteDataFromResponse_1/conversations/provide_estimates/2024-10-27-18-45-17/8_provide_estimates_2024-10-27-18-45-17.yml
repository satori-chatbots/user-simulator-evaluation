- User: Hi, Iâ€™m Maria Smith. I need an estimate for creating 3D renderings of 2 ceramic
    objects for my gallery. What would that cost?
- Assistant: Thank you for providing some details, Maria. I have noted that you need
    3D renderings for 2 ceramic objects. Could you please confirm if the media is
    indeed 3D rendering? Once confirmed, I can proceed with passing this information
    to the corresponding tool for an estimate.
- User: Yes, I confirm that I need 3D renderings. What would the estimate be for that?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for giving those details!.

    The cost is approximately $2,900, but it may vary based on factors such as the
    size of the artworks.'
