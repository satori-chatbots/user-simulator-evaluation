- User: Hi, Iâ€™m Maria Smith. Can I get an estimate for creating a video of three sculptures
    for my gallery?
- Assistant: Thank you for reaching out, Maria. I have the information that you are
    interested in creating a video. I also have the number of artworks as three and
    the type of artworks as sculptures. Is there anything else you would like to add
    or modify before I pass this information on for an estimate?
- User: Could you provide me with an estimate for that video?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for giving those details!.

    The cost is estimated to be approximately $6,000, but it may vary based on factors
    such as the size of the artworks.'
