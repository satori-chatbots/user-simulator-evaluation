Provide_an_estimate_to_create_a_video_of_2_pictures;True;Hello Maria, creating a simple video from two pictures typically involves a few steps such as selecting a video template, arranging the photos, and possibly adding transitions or music. The cost can vary depending on the complexity of these elements and any additional editing you might require. Generally, for a basic version, you could expect a price range between $50 to $150. If you need custom transitions or original music, the price could be higher. Let me know if there's any specific detail you'd like to focus on to give you a more accurate estimate.
