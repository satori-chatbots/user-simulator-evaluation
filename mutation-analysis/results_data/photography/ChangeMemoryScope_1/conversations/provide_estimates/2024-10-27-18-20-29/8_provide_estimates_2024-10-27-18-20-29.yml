interaction:
- User: Hi, Iâ€™m Maria Smith. I need an estimate for creating 3D renderings of 4 ceramic
    objects for my gallery. What would that cost?
- Assistant: Thank you for providing the details, Maria. I have noted that you need
    3D renderings of 4 ceramic objects. Let me pass this information to the corresponding
    tool to get an estimate for you.
- User: 'Maria: Thank you. How long would it take to complete the 3D renderings once
    I confirm the order?'
- Assistant: The time required to complete 3D renderings can vary depending on the
    complexity of the objects and the current workload. However, typically, it takes
    about 1 to 2 weeks to complete 3D renderings for 4 ceramic objects. Once you confirm
    the order, we can provide a more precise timeline.
- User: 'Maria: That sounds reasonable. Can you give me an estimate for the cost of
    creating 3D renderings for those 4 ceramic objects?'
- Assistant: 'Error: 500 Internal Server Error: Error executing the engine: Data is
    missing the property media'
