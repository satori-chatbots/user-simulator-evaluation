interaction:
- User: Hi, I’m Maria Smith. I need an estimate for photographing one piece of artwork
    in my gallery. What would that cost?
- Assistant: Hi Maria, I can help you with that. Could you please confirm the type
    of media you are interested in? Is it photography, video, or 3D rendering? Also,
    I see you mentioned one piece of artwork, but could you specify the type of artwork?
    Is it a picture, sculpture, or ceramic?
- User: I’m looking to photograph a painting. What would the estimate be for that?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for giving those details!.

    The cost is approximately $50.00, but it may vary based on factors such as the
    size of the artworks.'
