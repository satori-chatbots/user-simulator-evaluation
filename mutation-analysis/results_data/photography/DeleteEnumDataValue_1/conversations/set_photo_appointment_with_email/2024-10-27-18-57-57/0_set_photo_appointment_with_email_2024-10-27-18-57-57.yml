- User: Hi there! My name is Ann Clark, and I own an art gallery. Iâ€™d like to schedule
    an appointment for tomorrow. What times do you have available?
- Assistant: Hi Ann Clark! I have your name, but I still need your phone number to
    schedule the appointment. Also, could you please confirm the date for the appointment?
    You mentioned tomorrow, so would that be October 28, 2024? Additionally, if you'd
    like to provide an email, it's optional but can be helpful for communication.
    Thank you!
