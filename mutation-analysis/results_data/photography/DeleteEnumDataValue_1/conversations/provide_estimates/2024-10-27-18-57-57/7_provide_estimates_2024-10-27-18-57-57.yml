interaction:
- User: Hi, I’m Maria Smith. I’d like to get an estimate for creating a 3D rendering
    of one sculpture for my gallery. What would that cost?
- Assistant: Thank you for reaching out, Maria. I have the information that you're
    interested in a 3D rendering. Could you please confirm the number of artworks
    you need the rendering for and the type of artwork? From your previous message,
    it seems like it's one sculpture, but I just want to make sure I have all the
    details correct.
- User: I can confirm it's just one sculpture. What would the estimate be for that?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for giving those details!.

    The cost is estimated to be approximately $2,900, but it may vary based on factors
    such as the size of the artworks.'
