interaction:
- User: Hi, I’m Maria Smith. I’d like to get an estimate for creating a video of one
    sculpture for my gallery. What would that cost?
- Assistant: Thank you for reaching out, Maria. I have noted that you are interested
    in creating a video. I also see that you mentioned one sculpture. Could you please
    confirm if the media is indeed video, and the type of artwork is sculpture? Additionally,
    I have noted the number of artworks as one. Let me know if this is correct or
    if there are any changes.
- User: Yes, that's correct. I'm looking for a video of one sculpture. What would
    the estimate be for that?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for giving those details!.

    The cost is approximately $2000, but it may vary based on factors such as the
    size of the artworks.'
