interaction:
- User: Hi, I’m Maria Smith. I’d like to get an estimate for creating a video of one
    sculpture in my gallery. What would that cost?
- Assistant: Thank you for reaching out, Maria. I see that you are interested in creating
    a video. I have noted that you have one sculpture. Could you please confirm if
    the media type is indeed 'video' and the type of artwork is 'sculpture'? If so,
    I have all the information I need to proceed.
- User: Yes, that's correct. I'm looking for a video of one sculpture. What would
    the estimate be for that?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for giving those details!.

    The cost is approximately $2000, but it may vary based on factors such as the
    size of the artworks.'
