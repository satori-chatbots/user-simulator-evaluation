- User: Hi, I’m Maria Smith. I’d like to get an estimate for creating a 3D rendering
    of one sculpture for my gallery. What would that cost?
- Assistant: Thank you for reaching out, Maria. I have the information that you're
    interested in a 3D rendering. Could you please confirm the number of artworks
    you need the rendering for and the type of artwork? From your previous message,
    it seems like it's one sculpture, but I just want to make sure I have all the
    details correct.
- User: I can confirm it's just one sculpture. What would the estimate be for that?
- Assistant: Thanks for giving those details!.
- User: 'User: Great! What would the estimate be for creating a 3D rendering of that
    one sculpture?'
- Assistant: 'Thank you for confirming the details, Maria. I have all the necessary
    information: you''re interested in a 3D rendering for one sculpture. I will now
    pass this information to the corresponding tool to get an estimate for you.'
- User: 'User: How long does it typically take to complete the 3D rendering once I
    place the order?'
- Assistant: The time it takes to complete a 3D rendering can vary depending on the
    complexity of the sculpture and the current workload. However, typically, it can
    take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Once you place the order,
    we can provide a more precise timeline based on the specifics of your project.
- User: What is the estimated price for the 3D rendering?
- Assistant: Thanks for giving those details!.
