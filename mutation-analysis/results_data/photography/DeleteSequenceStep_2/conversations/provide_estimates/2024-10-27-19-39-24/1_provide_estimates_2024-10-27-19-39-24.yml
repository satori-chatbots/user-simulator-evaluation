- User: Hi, Iâ€™m Maria Smith. Can I get an estimate for photographing 4 sculptures
    in my gallery?

    an estimate for photographing 4 sculptures. Could you please confirm if the media
    is photography? '

    pass this information to the corresponding tool to get an estimate for you.
- User: 'User: How long would the photography session take for those 4 sculptures?'
- Assistant: The duration of a photography session for 4 sculptures can vary depending
    on several factors, such as the complexity of the setup, lighting requirements,
    and any specific artistic considerations you might have. On average, a session
    for 4 sculptures might take anywhere from 2 to 4 hours. However, for a more precise
    estimate, it would be best to discuss the details with the photographer who will
    be handling the session.
- User: Could you give me a ballpark figure for the cost of photographing those 4
    sculptures?
