Provide_an_estimate_to_photograph_1_pictures;True;Assistant: Certainly, Maria! The estimate for photographing one piece of artwork will depend on factors such as the location of your gallery, the size of the artwork, and the specific services you require (e.g., digital retouching, special lighting, etc.). Generally, the cost can range from $100 to $300 per piece. Can you provide more details so I can give a more accurate quote?
