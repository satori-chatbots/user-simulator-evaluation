- User: Hi, I’m Maria Smith. Can I get an estimate for creating a video of 5 ceramic
    objects for my gallery?
- Assistant: Thank you for the information, Maria. I have noted that you are interested
    in creating a video of 5 ceramic objects. Let me pass this information to the
    corresponding tool for an estimate.
- User: 'Maria: Thank you. How long would the video be?'
- Assistant: The length of the video can vary based on your specific needs and the
    complexity of the project. Typically, art gallery videos can range from a few
    minutes to longer, depending on how detailed you want each ceramic object to be
    showcased. Could you please specify the desired length of the video, or any particular
    details you have in mind? This will help us provide a more accurate estimate and
    timeline for your project.
- User: I’m looking for a video that’s around 3 minutes long. Can you provide an estimate
    for that?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for giving those details!.

    The cost is estimated to be approximately $5,000, but it may vary based on factors
    such as the size of the artworks.'
