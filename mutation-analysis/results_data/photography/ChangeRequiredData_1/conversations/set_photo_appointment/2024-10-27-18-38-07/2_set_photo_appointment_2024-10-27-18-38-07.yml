    or any other marks. Use a soft, lint-free cloth to gently clean the surface.


    2. **Check for Damage**: Inspect the artwork for any damage or imperfections that
    might need attention before the session.


    3. **Framing and Mounting**: If the artwork is to be photographed in a frame,
    make sure the frame is clean and in good condition. Ensure that the artwork is
    securely mounted.


    4. **Lighting Considerations**: While we provide professional lighting, if there
    are specific lighting conditions you prefer, please let us know in advance.


    5. **Background and Props**: Decide if you want any specific background or props
    to be included in the photos. We can accommodate various setups as per your requirements.
