- User: Hi, I’m Maria Smith. I’d like to get an estimate for creating a video of two
    pictures for my art gallery. What would that cost?
- Assistant: Hi Maria! I see that you're interested in creating a video. I have noted
    the media as video and the number of artworks as two. Could you please confirm
    the type of artworks? Are they pictures, sculptures, or ceramics?
